> We're trying to use the SisProto to get an estimate for two targets: CLASS and NSP
--- potential assessments if we've succeeded: compare to LBE (the baseline value given by medical experts)?


Data
Tendency is categorical
> all other are either discrete or continuous numerical variables
> pattern net uses one hot encoding, we transform the classes like that

-- CLASS --
10 labels that are unequally distributed


Q (for Simon): does each scan belong to a single patient? is it done over time? --> check nnproperty.net_divideMode
Q: which features are important? highly correlated ones? Can we remove them?
Q: should we split the data? Should we use only test or validation to assess performance
Q: (for Simon): is the p value in the spreadsheet supposed to be 0 

Initial empirical test
> all features, pattern net, N = [1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20,25]; shows 10 has the best Cross entropy value 0.0426699 and a validation accuracy of 79.3%

> only sispro features, pattern net

> check correlations
