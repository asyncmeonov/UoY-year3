abstract="Since the introduction of cardiotocography, variability within the fetal heart rate pattern has received attention. The significance of this phenomenon with respect to the assessment of fetal condition and later on with respect to the analysis of fetal activity states has been studied extensively (Hammacher et al. 1968, 1974). Detailed and/or quantitative analysis of this variability presents, however, a number of problems due to technical and scaling factors and definition problems (de Haan 1973a, b). This means that, especially in research concerning this parameter, its correct definition and quantification is necessary.",
