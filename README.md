## 3rd year ML modules

My 2019-2020 Comp Sci 3rd year at University of York solutions to the assessments (and practicals, where applicable) for the modules Introduction to Neural Networks (INNS), Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Models (MLPG) and Fundamentals of Machine Learning (FUML).

---
**FUML (81%)** is an introductory module covering the topics of linear/logistic regression and their L1/L2 penalised variants, PCA, cross-validation, basis functions and hypothesis testing (and interpretation of results and confidence intervals)

_python :: anaconda and jupyter, focus on the libraries sklearn, pandas, numpy_

---

**MLPG (86%)** is an advanced module covering probabilistic graphical models and topics such as Bayesian Networks (in frequentist and Bayesian contexts), Naive Bayes, HMMs,hierarchical models, approximate inferencing (and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Markov Chains and Variational sampling techniques) and the EM algorithm

_pyStan :: the python interface for the probabilistic language STAN_

**INNS (65%)** is an introductory module covering Neural Network learning and interpretation topics for FFNNs and CNNs

_Matlab_
